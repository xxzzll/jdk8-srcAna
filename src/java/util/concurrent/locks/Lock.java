/**
 * Lock的实现类会比synchronized关键字提供更多的加锁方法。
 * 这些方法允许更加灵活的结构，拥有更多不同的性质，并且支持多种Condition对象。
 *
 * {@code Lock} implementations provide more extensive locking
 * operations than can be obtained using {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements.  They allow more flexible structuring, may have
 * quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
 * {@link Condition} objects.
 *
 * Lock是控制多线程对相同资源访问的工具。通常，lock提供了对共享资源的线程独占性：
 * 一次只能有一个线程获得该对象所有访问的锁。但是，有些locks允许多个线程共享资源
 * 比如读Lock（ReadWriteLock）。
 *
 * <p>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
 * multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
 * shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
 * all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
 * a shared resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * 使用synchronized方法或者代码块是重量级额锁，与该锁相关的所有资源都被监视。
 * synchronized获得锁和释放锁都在相同的作用域内。
 *
 * <p>The use of {@code synchronized} methods or statements provides
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.
 *
 * 当需要更灵活地使用锁的时候，synchronized方法或者代码块的作用于机制让监视锁的编程变得容易，
 * 并且帮助避免一些常见的涉及锁机制的编程错误。例如。一些用于并发遍历数据的算法需要使用hand-over-hand
 * 或者chain locking：访问nodeA的时候获得锁，然后访问nodeB，释放nodeA的锁，并获得nodeC, 释放nodeB
 * 的锁，并获得nodeD,依次执行。
 * Lock接口的实现可以通过在不同的作作用域内获得或者释放锁达到这样的操作，并且可以按照任意的顺序释放或者获取任意数量的锁。
 *
 * <p>While the scoping mechanism for {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
 * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
 * there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
 * flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
 * concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
 * &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or &quot;chain locking&quot;: you
 * acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
 * C, then release B and acquire D and so on.  Implementations of the
 * {@code Lock} interface enable the use of such techniques by
 * allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
 * and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
 * order.
 *
 * Lock接口的实现增加了灵活性，但也有其他方面的限制。由于缺少块结构的加锁方式，Lock接口的实现类不能
 * 实现synchronized自动释放锁的功能。大多数情况下，需要使用如下的用法。
 *
 *
 * <p>With this increased flexibility comes additional
 * responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
 * automatic release of locks that occurs with {@code synchronized}
 * methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
 * should be used:
 *
 * 需要手动实现加锁和释放锁
 *  <pre> {@code
 * Lock l = ...;
 * l.lock();
 * try {
 *   // access the resource protected by this lock
 * } finally {
 *   l.unlock();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * 当锁和释放锁发生在不同的作用域，需要注意所有的代码执行完毕，需要使用try...catch结构
 * 保证锁的释放
 *
 * When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
 * taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
 * held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
 * lock is released when necessary.
 *
 * 相比于synchronized方法，Lock接口的实现类提供了额外的非阻塞获得锁（tryLock()方法），获得
 * 一定时限的锁（tryLock(long, TimeUnit)方法）。
 *
 * <p>{@code Lock} implementations provide additional functionality
 * over the use of {@code synchronized} methods and statements by
 * providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
 * #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
 * interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
 * the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).
 *
 * Lock接口的实现类除了实现monitor lock的功能之外还能实现其他功能，
 * 比如保证执行顺序，不可重入的锁，或者死锁检测等。如果实现了这些功能，
 * 需要在文档中进行说明。
 *
 * <p>A {@code Lock} class can also provide behavior and semantics
 * that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
 * such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
 * detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
 * then the implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * Lock实现类对象是普通对象，可以用作synchronized的锁对象。
 * 但是十分不推荐这种用法。
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code Lock} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement.
 * Acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a {@code Lock} instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Lock}
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any
 * parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being
 * thrown.
 *
 *
 * 内存同步
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
 *
 * 所有Lock接口的实现类都会强制内存同步。
 *
 * <p>All {@code Lock} implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
 * lock, as described in
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
 * The Java Language Specification (17.4 Memory Model)</a>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A successful {@code lock} operation has the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a successful <em>Lock</em> action.
 * <li>A successful {@code unlock} operation has the same
 * memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>Unlock</em> action.
 * </ul>
 *
 * 不成功的锁和释放锁操作，和重入的锁和释放锁操作不要求内存同步。
 *
 * Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
 * synchronization effects.
 *
 * 实现须知
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 *
 *
 *
 * <p>The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
 * characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
 * qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
 * acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given {@code Lock}
 * class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
 * exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
 * lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
 * ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
 * defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
 * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
 * method entry.
 *
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
