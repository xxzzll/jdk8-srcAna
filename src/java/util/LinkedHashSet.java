/**
 * HashTable和LinkedList对Set接口的实现，存入数据有序。
 * LinkedHashSet和HashMap不同在于LinkedHashSet使用一个双向链表存储所有的entry.
 * LinkedHashSet元素按照插入的顺序存储数据。
 *
 * <p>Hash table and linked list implementation of the <tt>Set</tt> interface,
 * with predictable iteration order.  This implementation differs from
 * <tt>HashSet</tt> in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through
 * all of its entries.  This linked list defines the iteration ordering,
 * which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set
 * (<i>insertion-order</i>).  Note that insertion order is <i>not</i> affected
 * if an element is <i>re-inserted</i> into the set.  (An element <tt>e</tt>
 * is reinserted into a set <tt>s</tt> if <tt>s.add(e)</tt> is invoked when
 * <tt>s.contains(e)</tt> would return <tt>true</tt> immediately prior to
 * the invocation.)
 *
 * 该数据结构对于传递有顺序的数据很有用。
 *
 * <p>This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally
 * chaotic ordering provided by {@link HashSet}, without incurring the
 * increased cost associated with {@link TreeSet}.  It can be used to
 * produce a copy of a set that has the same order as the original, regardless
 * of the original set's implementation:
 * <pre>
 *     void foo(Set s) {
 *         Set copy = new LinkedHashSet(s);
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * This technique is particularly useful if a module takes a set on input,
 * copies it, and later returns results whose order is determined by that of
 * the copy.  (Clients generally appreciate having things returned in the same
 * order they were presented.)
 *
 * LinkedHashSet支持所有的Set操作，并能够存入null元素。
 * 对于add(), contains(), remove()操作，可以实现常数时间的操作。LinkedHashSet的效率只是略低于HashSet，
 * 这是因为双向链表需要维护前后的引用。
 * 对LinkedHashSet的遍历和Set的size线性相关，和链表的capacity无关；
 * 遍历HashSet的开支更大，与链表的capacity线性相关。
 *
 * <p>This class provides all of the optional <tt>Set</tt> operations, and
 * permits null elements.  Like <tt>HashSet</tt>, it provides constant-time
 * performance for the basic operations (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>contains</tt> and
 * <tt>remove</tt>), assuming the hash function disperses elements
 * properly among the buckets.  Performance is likely to be just slightly
 * below that of <tt>HashSet</tt>, due to the added expense of maintaining the
 * linked list, with one exception: Iteration over a <tt>LinkedHashSet</tt>
 * requires time proportional to the <i>size</i> of the set, regardless of
 * its capacity.  Iteration over a <tt>HashSet</tt> is likely to be more
 * expensive, requiring time proportional to its <i>capacity</i>.
 *
 * LinkedHashSet的初始容量和装载因子是最重要的两个参数，但是较大的初始容量对遍历的影响不大，
 * 不像HashSet。
 *
 * <p>A linked hash set has two parameters that affect its performance:
 * <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  They are defined precisely
 * as for <tt>HashSet</tt>.  Note, however, that the penalty for choosing an
 * excessively high value for initial capacity is less severe for this class
 * than for <tt>HashSet</tt>, as iteration times for this class are unaffected
 * by capacity.
 *
 * LinkedHashSet线程不同步。
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads modifies the set, it <em>must</em> be synchronized
 * externally.  This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some
 * object that naturally encapsulates the set.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the set: <pre>
 *   Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet(...));</pre>
 *
 * 返回的iterator是快速失败的。
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> method are
 * <em>fail-fast</em>: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator
 * is created, in any way except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt>
 * method, the iterator will throw a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
 * and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
 * an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *

 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
